# Requirements and Installation
The whole analysis-related codes (except for some data collection codes in the dir `./codes/data_collection/...`) 
should run with a **Python** environment, regardless of operating systems theoretically. 
We successfully execute all the codes in both Windows (Win10, Win11) machines and a macOS (Sequoia 15.2) machine.
More detailed info is as below:
